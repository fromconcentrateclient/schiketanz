        <p class="mb-6">
          M. Schiketanz Real Estate was founded by Margaret Schiketanz in 1953. For 68 years, our office operated from the same premises on King Street East. We have since moved to our current modern office at 582 Frederick St., Kitchener.

We manage many residential and commercial properties located in the KW Region, ensuring our buildings are well maintained and cared for by a truly dedicated team of individuals—many of whom are long-term employees.
